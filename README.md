# Task Manager

A to-do list-type project using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

---
## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package, npm, installed in your environment.

### Node

You can install node js and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

```sh
> sudo apt install nodejs
> sudo apt install npm
```

If the installation is successful, you can run the following command.
```sh
> node --version
v16.20.2

> npm --version
8.19.4
```

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, open the command line again and be happy.
```sh
> npm install npm -g
```
